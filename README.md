Data Enrichment and Fitness recommendation Model

Fitness Recommendation AI — End-to-End Project Documentation
1. Problem Statement
    Modern fitness journeys often fail due to one-size-fits-all meal and workout plans that ignore individual differences in body type, metabolism, goals, and adherence levels.
People struggle to:

Know how many calories they need per day to reach their goals.
Get personalized meal and exercise plans that fit their lifestyle.
Receive adaptive recommendations based on their real progress over time.
This project aims to solve these problems using Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven personalization.


2.Project Objective
To build an AI-powered fitness recommendation system that:

Predicts a user’s daily calorie requirement based on personal attributes and goals.
Generates a personalized meal plan and workout routine that align with the calorie target and goal.
Tracks user progress over time (weight, adherence, energy level) to adapt recommendations dynamically.
The end goal is to provide an intelligent, continuously learning fitness assistant.

3.Methodology Overview
he system will be developed in *phases*, evolving from a rule-based MVP to an adaptive ML system.

| Phase | Focus | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| *Phase 1* | Data Setup | Gather and structure user profile, meal, and workout datasets. |
| *Phase 2* | Calorie Prediction | Build a regression model to predict daily calorie needs based on user profile. |
| *Phase 3* | Personalized Recommendation | Generate meals and workouts matching calorie goals and user preferences. |
| *Phase 4* | Progress Tracking | Collect feedback such as adherence, weight change, and energy level. |
| *Phase 5* | Adaptive Learning | Retrain model weekly using progress data to make adaptive calorie/workout recommendations. |
| *Phase 6* | Multi-User Intelligence | Use collaborative filtering to recommend meals/workouts based on similar users’ success. |
| *Phase 7* | Deployment | Build a Streamlit dashboard for real-time interaction and visualization. |
